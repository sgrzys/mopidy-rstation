   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pi-jukebox's documentation!
======================================

Pi-Jukebox is a application which you can use with a Raspberry Pi with touchscreen. Although it is made with a 320x240 touchscreen, it should be fairly simple to adjust it for larger screens (in later versions I'm planning to do some scaling).

I wanted my music player to be able to access a NAS drive which contained my music collection, but also I wanted to be able to play music friends brought on their USB stick.

Future plans include:
# Bluetooth streaming
# Switching between single room and multi-room simultaneous playback.
